# Indian_Start_up

The purpose of this study is to gather past data on start-ups in India to better understand 
how, and where future companies will be funded.

Using this data:

In https://github.com/ptlong11/DataScienceGuidedCapstone/blob/master/2nd%20capstone%20(1).ipynb we understand the Indian state most of the startup
funding is going to. The states with the most start-ups funded are Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi.

In https://github.com/ptlong11/DataScienceGuidedCapstone/blob/master/2nd%20capstone%20(1).ipynb we find the industries that are being funded the most, the amount they are being funded, and where the fudning is coming from. Some of the top places start-ups are getting funding from are seed funding. There are over 170 unique industries that these start ups are part of.
Something to note. I wanted to make sure that the start-ups were being grouped into each state, so in the data from https://www.kaggle.com/paree24/india-gdp-growth-world-bank-1961-to-2017 and https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=20006, the start-ups were grouped per city, I coded each city to their respective state.

in https://github.com/ptlong11/DataScienceGuidedCapstone/blob/master/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb We take a deeper look into which states are most funded, and by how much.
At first glance it might seem that there are no start-ups in the rest of the country getting funding besides the ones in Delhi. However, if you break the data down a bit more there are certainly start-ups getting a lot of money in the rest of the counrty. The start-ups that are coming out of Chandigarh and Goa, as well as others, are getting good funding compared to mass in Delhi.

Again, we can see Delhi dominates most of the funding, per capita. However, the other two states; Chandigarth and Goa, both have startups that have recived large amounts of Prive Equity funding as well as Seed funiding.

I wanted to find out if there was any specific timing of investments, a 'capital raising season' during the year. 
In https://github.com/ptlong11/DataScienceGuidedCapstone/blob/master/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb 
We can see that Private Equity funding, as well as, Seed Funding is distributed throughout the year. However, there is some evidence that as the year contiunes we can see that funding in other areas ramps up. This could be the same start-ups reciving multiple roudns of funding throughout the year, or, companies starting to look at Indian Start-ups beginning at the start of the year.

In https://github.com/ptlong11/DataScienceGuidedCapstone/blob/master/Capstone%20Two%20-%20Modeling.ipynb Linear Regression model, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boost Regressor, and Neural Network models are explored.

I am able to recommend that if an outside investor is looking to invest in Indian start-ups to start in Delhi, as that is where most start-ups are located.
However, there are start-ups to be funded that are outside of Delhi, which, may offer more looked over opportunities.
Most start-ups are funded by "Seed Rounds". A seed round is a financing round that raises initial capital to start a business. Seed capital often comes from the company founders' personal assets, friends and family, angel investors, and VCs.
The type of industry most heavily invested in is consumer services. Those are also the most numerous. There are opporunities to invest in that industry, but, like the states, there may be opporunity in other industries that aren't as tapped.
